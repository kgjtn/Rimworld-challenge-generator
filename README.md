# Rimworld challenge generator
## Description
this is a short project i made that is supposed to help you when you don't know what to do in rimworld anymore. it will randomly pick a scenario, storyteller, Difficulty and some goals. 
## How to add your own things
you can add your own storytellers or just go into the data folder and edit the files. 
in storytellers, difficulties and scenarios you just add the new thing's name to a new line. in goals you should format it like this

**Name,Description,points**

so for example a goal looks like this

**Ancient machinery,Complete the Archonexus ending,3**

the points value is used to determine the difficulty of the mission. the more points, the more difficult the mission. at the start you will input the number of points you want the generator to use, so generally use more points for longer playthroughs

### Do not use commas in the goals description / name it will break it.
